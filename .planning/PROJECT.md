# Presto Agent Skills

## Current State

v1.0 shipped on 2026-05-30. The repository now has a documentation-first portable skill framework: contributor entry docs, directory ownership rules, project agent instructions, a canonical `SKILL.md` template, runtime adapter notes inside that template, and a compatibility matrix covering Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent.

The v1 repository deliberately does not include example skills, standalone adapter directories, scaffold tooling, schema checks, runtime harnesses, or publishing automation. Those remain future work until a concrete contributor need justifies them.

## What This Is

Presto Agent Skills is a portable skill repository for authoring agent skills once and adapting them across multiple AI agent runtimes. The initial targets are Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent, with OpenClaw and Hermes Agent treated as mandatory first-class compatibility targets.

The repository is currently a stable documentation-first framework. New skill work should begin from `templates/skill/SKILL.md`; runtime differences belong in that file's Runtime Adapter Notes unless a later milestone introduces generated wrappers or runtime-specific packaging.

## Core Value

A skill authored in the canonical repository format can be understood, reviewed, and adapted by every supported agent runtime with minimal manual rewrite.

## Requirements

### Validated

- [x] Define a clear repository structure for skills, templates, runtime compatibility docs, optional examples, and GSD planning files. - v1.0
- [x] Provide a canonical `SKILL.md` authoring template that can serve as the single source of truth. - v1.0
- [x] Document adapter expectations for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent. - v1.0
- [x] Treat OpenClaw and Hermes Agent as mandatory supported runtimes, not optional future targets. - v1.0
- [x] Add project-level agent instructions through `AGENTS.md`, including the Simplified Chinese response requirement. - v1.0
- [x] Keep examples out of v1 unless a concrete contributor need appears. - v1.0

### Active

- [ ] Define the next milestone's requirements from current contributor needs.
- [ ] Revisit optional example guidance only when a concrete contributor workflow needs it.

### Out of Scope

- Automated scaffold CLI - useful later, but v1 focused on stable repository shape and human-readable contracts.
- Schema validation and lint scripts - deferred until the canonical format is exercised by real skills.
- Publishing or package-manager distribution - premature before the canonical contract and compatibility docs are proven useful.
- Full runtime execution test harnesses - requires per-runtime environments and should follow after the compatibility contract is stable.
- Example-heavy showcase expansions - deferred; v1 keeps `templates/skill/SKILL.md` as the primary authoring path.

## Context

This is a greenfield repository initialized in `/Users/mrered/Developer/Presto-Agent-Skills`. The project is now ready to serve as a shared home for agent skills that can be consumed by different agent ecosystems without locking the author into one vendor's syntax.

v1.0 shipped 3 phases and 3 plans:

- Phase 1 established the contributor-facing repository contract, directory responsibilities, agent rules, and GSD baseline.
- Phase 2 made `templates/skill/SKILL.md` the canonical copyable artifact and documented runtime compatibility for all six required runtimes.
- Phase 3 removed unused examples and standalone adapter files, keeping examples optional until they solve a real contributor need.

## Next Milestone Goals

The next milestone should start with `/gsd:new-milestone` and a fresh requirements pass. Likely candidates are scaffold tooling, skill schema/lint checks, install/export documentation, or a contributor-driven example, but none should be treated as committed until the new milestone is scoped.

## Constraints

- **Runtime compatibility**: OpenClaw and Hermes Agent must remain represented in skill authoring guidance - they are required targets.
- **Source of truth**: Prefer one canonical skill source plus embedded runtime adapter notes - this reduces drift across agents.
- **Scope discipline**: Keep documentation-first work lean; add tooling only after the repository shape is exercised.
- **Language**: Agent-facing responses in this repository should be Simplified Chinese unless a file format or downstream runtime requires otherwise.
- **Portability**: Avoid assuming one agent's proprietary tool syntax in the canonical skill body; isolate those differences in adapter sections.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use a canonical `SKILL.md` plus runtime adapter guidance | Best balance between portability and practical runtime differences; avoids maintaining six divergent skill definitions | Good - shipped in v1.0 |
| Support Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent from v1 | User explicitly requires broad agent compatibility and mandatory OpenClaw/Hermes support | Good - documented in v1.0 |
| Start with docs, templates, and planning first, without v1 examples | User wants the canonical skill contract first; example material is deferred until it has concrete contributor value | Good - v1.0 removed unused examples |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

After each phase transition:
1. Requirements invalidated? Move to Out of Scope with reason.
2. Requirements validated? Move to Validated with phase reference.
3. New requirements emerged? Add to Active.
4. Decisions to log? Add to Key Decisions.
5. "What This Is" still accurate? Update if drifted.

After each milestone:
1. Full review of all sections.
2. Core Value check - still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope - reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state.
